  # This is the grasp frame which has the same position as grasp_frame but its orientation is
  # the desired orientation of the tcp frame.
  # So the planner computes the position of the pre-grasp and lift in the grasp_frame first
  # and then expresses those positions relative to the desired orientation of the tcp frame.

  # This is the computed pre-grasp frame which has the same orientation as the grasp frame.
  # It's origin is located by going the pre-grasp distance along the negative Z-axis of the grasp frame.

  # This is the computed lift grasp frame which has the same orientation as the grasp frame.
  # It's origin is the grasp frame's origin shifted by the lift height in the direction of the world frame's positive Z-axis.
